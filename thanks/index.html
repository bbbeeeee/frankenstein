        <h2>Thanks</h2>
        <p>The Frankenstein GRID has been supported by an extraordinary number of extraordinary individuals. Artists' biographies are listed below; deep gratitude goes out to each contributor for sharing their work with this installation and making it something worth seeing! I would like to thank Daniel Cadigan, technical director, for being a life force from the beginning. None of it could have happened without Daniel, and certainly not with such fun. Thank you also to Angreet McClosky and Stephen Hamman for being consultants ever ready with invaluable insights. We have also been the lucky recipients of many volunteers' time and expertise. Particular mention goes to Mike Edwards, Stephen Hitchcock, Craig Manno, and Keenan Molner for hours too exhausting to count. The construction process did indeed turn out to be monstrous, but, thanks to the generosity of so many people, its monstrosity will be remembered fondly. </p>
          <p> With gratitude, Charlotte </p>

<p> CHARLOTTE THUN-HOHENSTEIN (creative director, curator) is a PhD student in Stanford's history department. She works on early modern Europe with Paula Findlen and is especially interested in cartography and the Society of Jesus. Art constitutes a double life. This has hitherto largely involved performance, which she pursued professionally in New York City before graduate school. She hopes to continue fostering dialogue between the arts and sciences. </p>
