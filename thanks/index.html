        <h2>Thanks</h2>
        <p>The Frankenstein GRID has been supported by an extraordinary number of extraordinary individuals. Artists' biographies are listed below; deep gratitude goes out to each contributor for sharing their work with this installation and making it something worth seeing! I would like to thank Daniel Cadigan, technical director, for being a life force from the beginning. None of it could have happened without Daniel, and certainly not with such fun. Thank you also to Angrette McCloskey and Stephen Hamman for being consultants always ready with invaluable insights. We have also been the lucky recipients of many volunteers' time and expertise. Particular mention goes to Mike Edwards, Stephen Hitchcock, Craig Manno, and Keenan Molner for hours too exhausting to count. The construction process did indeed turn out to be monstrous, but, thanks to their generosity, its monstrosity will be remembered fondly. </p>
          <p> With gratitude, Charlotte </p>

<p> CHARLOTTE THUN-HOHENSTEIN (creative director, curator) is a PhD student in Stanford's history department. She works on early modern Europe with Paula Findlen and is especially interested in cartography and the Society of Jesus. Art constitutes a double life. This has hitherto largely involved performance, which she pursued professionally in New York City before graduate school. She hopes to continue fostering dialogue between the arts and sciences. </p>

         <p> CERE DAVIS grew up in west coast of the US fascinated with physics and real-world manifestations of dynamic imbalance.  After researching volcanic lighting in Alaska and wintering over at South Pole, Antarctica she moved to the Bay Area of California in 2013.  Inspired by her creative surroundings, she began using her creative energy and professional background in physics & engineering to explore her passion for creating improbable embodiments through fusing the worlds of sculpture, science and technology.  Her works aim to inspire conversations which illuminate the magic and wonder of the physical world.  She utilizes materials common to our everyday experience as a way of revealing what is hidden in plain sight and uses her exhibits, lectures and exploratory research to connect seemingly disparate fields of study.  In doing so, she aims to broaden our normative utilitarian view of nature through re-framing phenomenon common to our everyday experience.  Her work is best described as a form of neonaturalism, whereby inherent material properties are re-contextualized to reveal their natural response to surroundings.  She aims to inspire creative learning through her interactive exhibits and offer a refreshing counterbalance to our increasingly isolating and sterile urban environments. 

Cere has been awarded the People's Choice award in 2015 for Oakland Aeolian Day for her acousto-kinetic sculpture and in 2018 by the Awesome Foundation for her opto-kinetic sculpture, Liquid Loom. She produces, collaborates and participates in projects ranging from dance performance, science exhibits and art festivals.  Her works have shown in galleries, science festivals, conferences and public outreach events throughout the USA and internationally.  She a science educator, artistic director at Counter Culture Labs and science-artist at Chabot Space & Science Center, where she collaborates with scientists and artists to inspire scientific curiosity and participation through interactive art and critical making.
