        <h2>Thanks</h2>
        <p>The Frankenstein GRID has been supported by an extraordinary number of extraordinary individuals. Artists' biographies are listed below; deep gratitude goes out to each contributor for sharing their work with this installation and making it something worth seeing! I would like to thank Daniel Cadigan, technical director, for being a true life force from the beginning. None of it could have happened without Daniel, and certainly not with such fun. Thank you to Ramin Ahmari and Euan Yang for founding ArtX at such a timely moment and joining forces with the Frankenstein GRID :) and thank you to Eilaf Osman for granting us a glamorous debut. Thank you also to Angrette McCloskey and Stephen Hamman for being consultants always ready with invaluable insights. We have also been the lucky recipients of many volunteers' time and expertise. Particular mention goes to Mike Edwards, Stephen Hitchcock, Craig Manno, and Keenan Molner for hours too exhausting to count. The construction process did indeed turn out to be monstrous, but, thanks to their generosity and good company, its monstrosity will be remembered fondly. </p>
          <p> With gratitude, Charlotte </p>

<p> CHARLOTTE THUN-HOHENSTEIN (creative director, curator) is a PhD student in Stanford's history department. She works on early modern Europe with Paula Findlen and is especially interested in cartography and the Society of Jesus. Art constitutes a double life. This has hitherto largely involved performance, which she pursued professionally in New York City before graduate school. She hopes to continue fostering dialogue between the arts and sciences. </p>

         <p> CERE DAVIS grew up in west coast of the US fascinated with physics and real-world manifestations of dynamic imbalance.  After researching volcanic lighting in Alaska and wintering over at South Pole, Antarctica she moved to the Bay Area of California in 2013.  Inspired by her creative surroundings, she began using her creative energy and professional background in physics & engineering to explore her passion for creating improbable embodiments through fusing the worlds of sculpture, science and technology.  Her works aim to inspire conversations which illuminate the magic and wonder of the physical world.  She utilizes materials common to our everyday experience as a way of revealing what is hidden in plain sight and uses her exhibits, lectures and exploratory research to connect seemingly disparate fields of study.  In doing so, she aims to broaden our normative utilitarian view of nature through re-framing phenomenon common to our everyday experience.  Her work is best described as a form of neonaturalism, whereby inherent material properties are re-contextualized to reveal their natural response to surroundings.  She aims to inspire creative learning through her interactive exhibits and offer a refreshing counterbalance to our increasingly isolating and sterile urban environments. 

Cere has been awarded the People's Choice award in 2015 for Oakland Aeolian Day for her acousto-kinetic sculpture and in 2018 by the Awesome Foundation for her opto-kinetic sculpture, Liquid Loom. She produces, collaborates and participates in projects ranging from dance performance, science exhibits and art festivals.  Her works have shown in galleries, science festivals, conferences and public outreach events throughout the USA and internationally.  She a science educator, artistic director at Counter Culture Labs and science-artist at Chabot Space & Science Center, where she collaborates with scientists and artists to inspire scientific curiosity and participation through interactive art and critical making.

           <div class="piece-title">The ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AGENCY (EPA) is an artist collective founded in 2017 and named in response to the proposed defunding of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Appropriating the acronym EPA, the collective’s primary goal is to shift thinking around the terms environment, performance, and agency – using artistic, social, and embodied / kinesthetic practices to advocate for the agency of all living performers co-creating our environment, specifically through the lens of spontaneous urban plants, native or migrant. The Department of Weedy Affairs (DWA), a branch of the EPA, launched in Washington DC in May 2018 as part of the exhibition EPA meets EPA at Transformer Gallery. http://www.environmentalperformanceagency.com/</div>

        <p>LISA MA sees the subtle creations of new subcultures resulted from the geopolitics of the global production as the imaginative underbelly of tomorrow’s material culture. 

For the city of Ghent, Lisa created a culture of consuming the invasive species that 'The Vegetarian Capital of Europe', would otherwise pay to poison. Belgium spent nearly a million Euros for the humane killing of invasive geese in 2013. Lisa brought together a community that included the mayoral office, scientists, chefs, ecologists, urban planners and the Belgian National Station Canvas TV, to explore the clash of values between the killing of animals for our environment and the killing of animals for our foods.

By combining fringe communities, ethnographic research and speculative design, Lisa Ma socializes activism through unusual platforms of engagement. These social events are perceived as activism but function as services, gatherings, transient communities that deeply resonate with the global technological community.

Lisa holds a MA in Design Interactions at Royal College of Art in London and BA from Central Saint Martins. She worked as a designer/strategist with Pentagram and Deutsche Telekom's Creation Centre before making collaboration projects with TED Global in Edinburgh, Kanvas TV in Belgium and Broadway with Arts Council.

PERDITA PHILLIPS is an Australian artist most interested in the permeable boundaries between human and more-than-human lives. Her work revolves around ecological issues and social change. Working inside and outside gallery spaces, process and the creation of experiential events for audiences are strong elements in a wide-ranging and experimental conceptual practice. Walking, listening, mapping and exchange are used to traverse and integrate art, ecology and the concerns of nonhuman worlds. Whilst materially diverse, underlying themes of attention to ecosystem processes and a commitment to a resensitisation to the physical environment, are apparent.

Phillips completed a MA at Goldsmiths College (University of London, 1999) and has exhibited in Australia, USA, UK, Germany, Portugal and Canada. Phillip’s practice-based PhD was entitled fieldwork/fieldwalking: art, science and sauntering in the walkingcountry (2006, Edith Cowan University, Australia). She has undertaken two Australia Council-funded residencies at SymbioticA (Perth, Australia) about/with bowerbirds and thrombolites.
