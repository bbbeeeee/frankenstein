            <div class="piece-artist">Hearing is the first sense to develop in an embryo, as the Stereocilia are fully developed by the 10-week stage. For Aural Roots, sounds from scientific recordings using contact microphones inside the womb were mixed with filtered sounds from outside the body to construct a unique composition. The research and interactive development of the project-Auralroots was inspired by a residency SymbioticA University of Western Australia and at the Auditory Laboratory at the School of Anatomy, Physiology and Human Biology, with Professor Don Robertson and Dr. Helmy Mulders. AURALROOTS sheds light on the physiology, morphology and function of human hearing. </div>

            <p class="description">Michal Gavish created Dotplot and Pulldown, two animation videos based on imagery from Professor Onn Brandman’s laboratory at the biology department in Stanford University. The videos are construct of layered imagery of microscopy, X ray models and electrophoresis of proteins and DNA.  With an original soundtrack composed by Brandman, she creates moving portraits of the minute molecules that cannot be seen by the naked eye.</p>

            <div class="piece-artist">Microbial attraction/repulsion presents the relationships among bacteria collected from Dr. Lapointe’s skin microbiome after shaking hands with 1001 persons. Like stellar objects floating in space, different strains of bacteria come and go to form clusters of microbes with similar properties. This bacterial network is continuously evolving as his microbial identity is constantly changing in relation with the people he meets. Lapointe’s professional research, which is directly informed by his performance art salutations, contributes to the ongoing ‘genome revolution’. Most of our bodies is not human, but microbial: 50% of our bodies’ cells are not human, nor are 90% of the genes on our body…</div>
