            <div class="piece-artist">1) LIQUID LOOM optokinetic sculpture (liquid crystal) by Cere Davis, 2018.</div>
            <p class="description">LIQUID LOOM reveals the hidden nanoscale world of electron flow via the kinetic behavior of liquid crystal media responding to a dynamic user-guided electrostatic field. This exhibit lifts the mysterious veil of complex technology and reveals the inherent beauty of materials on which our modern LCD screens are based.</p>

            <div class="piece-artist">3) SUPRALIMINAL by Greg Niemeyer, 5:30, 2017. </div>
            <p class="description">SUPRALIMINAL celebrates the world through wave view. It is inspired “Turing patterns” and wave synthesis: Turing theorized in 1953 that waves of chemical concentrations interacting within a living organism might define its subsequent growth, a notion that has since been borne out by research. SUPRALIMINAL demonstrates this fundamental process of complex forms emerging out of simple ones. The piece was originally created for the ZKM Panorama Lab. An interactive version will be released in the Fall, 2018.</p>

            <div class="piece-title">4) KURAMOTO CYCLES by Nolan Lem, 13:13, 2016.</div>
            <div class="piece-artist">KURAMOTO CYCLES explores the rhythmic complexity inherent in networks of coupled oscillators. This dynamical system, known as Kuramoto Oscillators, model many of the synchronistic behaviors inherent in many of the biological and chemical systems found in nature (e.g. firefly synchronicity, bioluminescent algae, pacemaker cells, etc.). This piece examines the self-organizing behaviors that emerge as a result of their communicative interplay. The polyrhythmic complexities that emerge are a result of different groups of oscillators settling into unusual metrical regimes that suggest the musical dynamics of jazz, west-african, and tabla drums.</div>
            <p class="description">5) MANIFOLD by Yulia Pinkusevich, 13:58, 2016.</p>
            <p>MANIFOLD is a video installation which considers the origins of life in our universe, while observing space and time through a post human perspective. This project was created in collaboration with Paisiz of Tbilisi Georgia.</p>

                     <div class="piece-title">6) ArtX student art feature: FOREST MOTHER MEETS THE BLOB by Ian Avery.  </div>
            <div class="piece-artist">Music: Michael Betts, Ian Avery Bick; Video FX: Ian Avery Bick; Videography: Krista Kaija Bluesmith, Michael Betts; Dancers: 	Katie Shubat  	Celia Rath 	McKenna Leighton 	Simone Hadley  	Cas Parong  
</div>
            <p class="description">The piece investigates how the historic, ritualistic aspects of womenhood shape the modern world and how they are shaped by it. Computer vision is used to detect continuous forms - blobs - and superimpose them back on the environment. The computer loosesly follow the characters through their ritual, drawing a border around them. They are a discrete system of order within chaos. </p>

            <div class="piece-title">NB Audio interludes: NEURAL ORDINANCE by Nolan Lem: </div>
            <div class="piece-artist">“neural ordinance is comprised of sounds that are a result of my computer being trained to produce industrial noises. In this type of deep learning, recurrent neural nets literally teach the computer how to produce sounds that are representative of machines themselves. As such, this piece focuses on a large corpus of field-recorded sounds that include audio related to industrial drones, server farms, consumer electronics, HVAC noise, etc. After processing these recordings, the computer ‘dreams up’ sound based off of its own idea of what industrial noise is. If we can treat the computer as a superlative machine, the neural network seeks to reify a sonic representation of what the computer itself thinks it sounds like. In this way, it shows the computer trying to listen to itself.  

In this instance of the piece, the noise emanating from the speakers on the CCRMA stage were included into some of the training sets used in the synthesis. As a result, the output sound is a mixture of both real-life analog noise and the computer’s interpretation of the same. The sounds undulate, swell, and breathe to form an ecology of machine-interpreted awareness, one that suggests a strange convergence of the real and the digitally imagined, the sentient and the synthetic.  

The title is taken from the term 'noise ordinance' which refers to the noise regulations that are typically enforced by city zoning codes. In this case, the neural network acts as a governing agency that imposes its own definition of what is constituted by 'noise'.”
